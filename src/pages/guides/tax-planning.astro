            Most small business owners think about taxes once a year&mdash;in April, when it's already too late to do anything about them. The result? Bigger tax bills, missed deductions, and penalties for underpayment. Tax planning isn't about cheating the system. It's about understanding the rules well enough to keep more of what you've earned.
          </p>

          <!-- Why Tax Planning Matters -->
          <section id="why-tax-planning" class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Tax Planning Matters</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              As a small business owner, you're responsible for both the employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare&mdash;that's the self-employment (SE) tax at 15.3% on top of your income tax. If you earn $80,000 in net business income, you'll owe roughly $12,240 in SE tax alone before income tax even enters the picture.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Without planning, those numbers sneak up on you. The IRS expects you to pay taxes as you earn income, not in one lump sum at year-end. If you owe more than $1,000 at filing time, you'll face underpayment penalties. That means quarterly estimated payments are mandatory for most self-employed people and small business owners.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The good news? The tax code is loaded with deductions specifically designed for small businesses. Home office expenses, equipment purchases, retirement contributions, health insurance premiums&mdash;these can reduce your taxable income by tens of thousands of dollars. But only if you plan ahead and keep good records.
            </p>

            <div class="p-4 bg-emerald-500/10 border border-emerald-500/20 rounded-lg mb-6">
              <div class="font-semibold text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400 mb-2">The Real Cost of Not Planning</div>
              <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                A business owner earning $100,000 with no tax strategy might pay $28,000&ndash;$32,000 in combined taxes. The same owner with a basic plan&mdash;maxing out a solo 401(k), claiming home office, and timing equipment purchases&mdash;could reduce that by $8,000&ndash;$12,000. That's not a loophole. It's just knowing the rules.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Tax planning also protects your cash flow. If you set aside money for taxes throughout the year and pay quarterly, you'll never face a devastating April surprise. You can budget with confidence, reinvest in growth, and sleep better knowing the IRS isn't going to send you a penalty notice.

            <p class="mb-4">
              If you're self-employed, a sole proprietor, a partner, or an S-Corp shareholder, you likely need to make quarterly estimated tax payments. The IRS uses a pay-as-you-go system&mdash;they want their money throughout the year, not all at once on April 15th.

              Notice that the quarters aren't equal. Q2 only covers two months (April and May), while Q4 covers four months (September through December). This is an IRS quirk, not a typo. Plan your cash flow accordingly&mdash;your Q4 payment often needs to be larger if your business has a strong holiday season.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Safe Harbor Rule</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              You can avoid underpayment penalties even if you owe money at tax time by meeting one of the IRS "safe harbor" thresholds:
            </p>

            <div class="space-y-4 mb-6">
              <div class="p-4 bg-[var(--color-card)] rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)]">
                <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Option 1: 100% of Prior Year Tax</h4>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                  Pay at least 100% of last year's total tax liability through estimated payments (or withholding). If your AGI exceeded $150,000 last year, the threshold is 110%. This is the simplest approach&mdash;you know exactly what you owed last year, so divide by four and pay that amount each quarter.
                </p>
              </div>

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                  Pay at least 90% of this year's tax liability through estimated payments. This requires you to estimate your current year income accurately. It works best when your income is stable and predictable.

              <div class="font-semibold text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400 mb-2">Practical Example</div>
              <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                Say you owed $20,000 in total tax last year and your AGI was under $150,000. Your safe harbor is $20,000. Divide by four and pay $5,000 per quarter. Even if your income grows and you actually owe $28,000 this year, you won't face penalties&mdash;you just pay the $8,000 difference at filing time.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How to Make Payments</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Use IRS Form 1040-ES to calculate your estimated tax. Payments can be made through:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-[var(--color-muted)]">
              <li><strong>IRS Direct Pay</strong> (irs.gov/directpay) &mdash; free bank transfer, instant confirmation</li>
              <li><strong>EFTPS</strong> (Electronic Federal Tax Payment System) &mdash; requires enrollment, but allows scheduling</li>
              <li><strong>IRS2Go app</strong> &mdash; mobile payments via bank account or card</li>
              <li><strong>Credit/debit card</strong> &mdash; processing fees apply (1.85&ndash;1.98% for credit cards)</li>
              <li><strong>Mail a check</strong> with a 1040-ES payment voucher &mdash; slowest, no instant confirmation</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4">
              IRS Direct Pay is the best option for most people. It's free, immediate, and you get a confirmation number. Set calendar reminders two weeks before each due date so you never miss a payment.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Common Business Deductions</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Deductions reduce your taxable income, which reduces both your income tax and your self-employment tax. Every legitimate deduction you miss is money you're giving away. Here are the most valuable ones for small business owners:
            </p>

            <div class="space-y-6">
              <div class="p-5 bg-[var(--color-card)] rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)]">

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  If you use part of your home regularly and exclusively for business, you can deduct a portion of your rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance, and maintenance. There are two methods:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  <li><strong>Simplified method:</strong> $5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft (max $1,500/year). Easy, no receipts needed.</li>
                  <li><strong>Regular method:</strong> Calculate the percentage of your home used for business and deduct that percentage of actual expenses. More paperwork, but often a bigger deduction.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded text-sm">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> Your home is 1,500 sq ft. Your office is 150 sq ft (10%). Your annual housing costs are $24,000. Regular method deduction: $2,400. Simplified method: $750. The regular method wins by $1,650 in this case.

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  Section 179 lets you deduct the full purchase price of qualifying business equipment in the year you buy it, rather than depreciating it over several years. For 2026, the deduction limit is $1,220,000 with a spending cap of $3,050,000.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  Qualifying items include computers, software, office furniture, machinery, and vehicles used for business. This is one of the most powerful deductions available because it lets you reduce taxable income immediately.

                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded text-sm">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> You buy a $3,000 laptop and a $2,000 standing desk for your business. Under Section 179, you can deduct the full $5,000 this year instead of spreading it over 5&ndash;7 years.

                  The standard mileage rate is simpler, but if you drive an expensive or gas-hungry vehicle, actual expenses may be higher.

                  <strong>Important:</strong> You can't take this deduction for any month you were eligible for an employer-subsidized health plan (including a spouse's plan). The deduction also can't exceed your net self-employment income.

            <p class="mb-4">
              Your business structure directly determines how much tax you pay. Many small business owners start as sole proprietors because it's the default&mdash;no paperwork required. But as income grows, restructuring can save thousands in taxes every year.
            </p>

            <div class="space-y-6">

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  The simplest structure. All business income flows directly to your personal tax return (Schedule C). You pay income tax plus self-employment tax (15.3%) on all net profits. No separate business tax return is required.
                </p>

                  <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses earning under $50,000&ndash;$60,000 in net profit, or just starting out. The simplicity isn't worth giving up when the tax savings of other structures are minimal at lower income levels.

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  An LLC or corporation can elect S-Corp status with the IRS (Form 2553). The key benefit: you split income between a "reasonable salary" (subject to payroll taxes) and distributions (not subject to SE tax). This can save significant money as income grows.

                  <strong>Example:</strong> You earn $120,000 in net profit. As a sole proprietor, you pay SE tax on the full $120,000 = ~$18,360. As an S-Corp, you pay yourself a reasonable salary of $70,000 (payroll taxes: ~$10,710) and take $50,000 as a distribution (no SE tax). Annual savings: ~$7,650. Even after accounting for $2,000&ndash;$3,000 in extra accounting/payroll costs, you're ahead by $4,000&ndash;$5,000.

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-3">
                  <strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses consistently earning $60,000+ in net profit. The crossover point where S-Corp savings exceed the extra compliance costs is typically around $50,000&ndash;$70,000, depending on your state and accounting costs.

                  C-Corps pay a flat 21% corporate tax rate. Profits distributed as dividends are taxed again at the shareholder level (double taxation). This rarely makes sense for small businesses unless you're retaining significant earnings in the company or planning to raise investment capital.

                Don't rush into an S-Corp election. Run the numbers first.

              Good records are the foundation of tax planning. Without them, you'll miss deductions, make errors on your return, and have no defense in an audit. The IRS doesn't require a specific bookkeeping system&mdash;they just require that your records clearly show income and expenses.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-[var(--color-muted)]">
              <li><strong>Freelancers &amp; solo operators:</strong> Wave (free), or a spreadsheet with disciplined weekly updates. Wave handles invoicing and basic bookkeeping at no cost.</li>
              <li><strong>Growing businesses ($50K+ revenue):</strong> QuickBooks Self-Employed ($15/mo) or FreshBooks ($17/mo). Both categorize expenses automatically from bank feeds and generate tax-ready reports.</li>
              <li><strong>S-Corps &amp; businesses with employees:</strong> QuickBooks Online ($30+/mo) or Xero ($15+/mo). Full double-entry accounting, payroll integration, and multi-user access for your accountant.</li>
              <li><strong>Receipt tracking:</strong> Use your phone. Take a photo of every receipt immediately. Apps like Dext (formerly Receipt Bank) or even the built-in camera with a dedicated "Receipts" folder work fine. The goal is to never lose a receipt.</li>

                Set aside 30 minutes every week (Friday afternoon works well) to categorize transactions and file receipts. This one habit prevents the December scramble where you're digging through a shoebox of receipts. Thirty minutes weekly is far less painful than 30 hours in January.

            <p class="mb-4">
              The last quarter of the year is when tax planning pays its biggest dividends. You have a clear picture of your annual income, and there's still time to take action. Here are strategies that can meaningfully reduce your tax bill:
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Defer Income</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              If you're a cash-basis taxpayer (most small businesses are), you're taxed on income when you receive it, not when you earn it. In November and December, consider:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-[var(--color-muted)]">
              <li><strong>Delay invoicing:</strong> Send invoices in late December so payments arrive in January. You defer the income to the next tax year.</li>
              <li><strong>Delay project completion:</strong> If a large project wraps up in December, see if the final milestone payment can be scheduled for early January.</li>
              <li><strong>Be strategic, not greedy:</strong> Only defer income if you expect to be in the same or lower tax bracket next year. If your income is growing rapidly, deferral could actually cost you more if you land in a higher bracket.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Accelerate Deductions</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The flip side of deferring income: pull deductible expenses into the current year.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-[var(--color-muted)]">
              <li><strong>Buy equipment before Dec 31:</strong> That new laptop, software subscription, or office furniture? Buy it now to claim the Section 179 deduction this year.</li>
              <li><strong>Prepay expenses:</strong> Pay January rent in December, renew annual subscriptions, stock up on supplies. The IRS generally allows you to prepay and deduct up to 12 months of expenses.</li>
              <li><strong>Pay outstanding bills:</strong> Any business bills sitting in your inbox? Pay them before year-end so they count as this year's expenses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Max Out Retirement Contributions</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Retirement contributions are the most powerful year-end strategy because the amounts are so large. If you haven't maxed out your contributions, this is the time:

              <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                Let's say you earn $80,000 and haven't made any retirement contributions yet. You contribute $23,500 to your Solo 401(k) before December 31st. Your taxable income drops to $56,500. At the 22% bracket, that contribution saves you $5,170 in federal income tax&mdash;plus about $3,595 in self-employment tax (the deductible half). Total immediate savings: roughly $8,765. And the money grows tax-deferred for retirement.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Other Year-End Moves</h3>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-[var(--color-muted)]">
              <li><strong>Review estimated payments:</strong> Run your numbers in November. If you're short, you can increase your Q4 estimated payment (due January 15) to avoid penalties.</li>
              <li><strong>Harvest investment losses:</strong> If you have taxable brokerage accounts, sell losing positions to offset gains. You can deduct up to $3,000 in net capital losses against ordinary income.</li>
              <li><strong>Charitable contributions:</strong> If you itemize deductions, charitable donations reduce your taxable income. Consider donating appreciated stock directly to avoid capital gains tax.</li>
              <li><strong>HSA contributions:</strong> If you have a high-deductible health plan, max out your Health Savings Account ($4,300 individual, $8,550 family for 2026). Triple tax benefit: deductible going in, grows tax-free, tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses.</li>
              <li><strong>Review your business structure:</strong> December is the time to evaluate whether switching to an S-Corp makes sense for next year. The Form 2553 election is generally due by March 15 for the current tax year.</li>
