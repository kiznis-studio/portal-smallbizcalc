            Your income statement tells you if you made money last month. Your balance sheet tells you what you own and owe. But financial ratios tell you the <em>story</em> behind those numbers — whether your business is healthy, getting stronger, or quietly heading toward trouble. You don't need an accounting degree to use them. You just need to know which ones matter and what they're telling you.
          </p>

          <!-- Why Ratios Matter -->
          <section id="why-ratios-matter" class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Financial Ratios Matter</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Raw financial numbers are hard to interpret in isolation. Your business did $800,000 in revenue last year — is that good? You have $50,000 in debt — is that dangerous? You carry $120,000 in inventory — is that too much? Financial ratios turn these raw numbers into meaningful context by comparing one figure against another.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Think of ratios like vital signs at a doctor's office. Your blood pressure as a single number doesn't mean much, but compared against healthy ranges, it tells the doctor whether to relax or run more tests. Financial ratios work the same way. A current ratio of 2.5 tells you immediately that you have solid short-term liquidity. A debt-to-equity ratio of 4.0 tells you that you're heavily leveraged and vulnerable to downturns.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Ratios are especially powerful for three purposes: <strong>tracking trends over time</strong> (is your business getting healthier or weaker quarter by quarter?), <strong>comparing against industry benchmarks</strong> (how do you stack up against competitors?), and <strong>making decisions</strong> (should you take on more debt, hire more staff, or build up cash reserves?).
            </p>

            <div class="p-4 bg-emerald-500/10 border border-emerald-500/20 rounded-lg mb-6">
              <div class="font-semibold text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400 mb-2">When to Calculate Your Ratios</div>
              <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                At minimum, calculate key ratios quarterly when you review financial statements. Monthly is better if your business has seasonal swings or you're in a growth phase. If you're applying for a loan or pitching investors, expect them to calculate these ratios themselves — know your numbers before they do.
              </p>

          <!-- Liquidity Ratios -->
          <section id="liquidity-ratios" class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Liquidity Ratios</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Liquidity ratios answer a critical question: can you pay your bills? They measure your ability to cover short-term obligations — the invoices, loan payments, payroll, and expenses due in the next 12 months. A profitable business can still fail if it runs out of cash, so liquidity is arguably the most important category for small business owners to monitor.
            </p>

            <div class="space-y-6">
              <!-- Current Ratio -->
              <div class="p-5 bg-[var(--color-card)] rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)]">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Current Ratio</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  The most widely used liquidity measure. It compares everything you could convert to cash within a year (current assets) against everything you owe within a year (current liabilities). Current assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses. Current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term loans, and upcoming debt payments.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded font-mono text-sm">
                  Current Ratio = Current Assets &divide; Current Liabilities
                </div>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-3">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> Sarah's bakery has $80,000 in current assets (cash, receivables, ingredient inventory) and $40,000 in current liabilities (supplier invoices, short-term loan payments). Current ratio = $80,000 &divide; $40,000 = <strong>2.0</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="mt-3 text-sm">

                  <span class="text-red-600 dark:text-red-400 font-medium">Danger:</span> Below 1.0
                </div>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-2">
                  A ratio below 1.0 means you owe more in the short term than you have available — a cash crunch is looming. Above 3.0 might mean you have too much idle cash or unsold inventory that could be put to better use.
                </p>
              </div>

              <!-- Quick Ratio -->
              <div class="p-5 bg-[var(--color-card)] rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)]">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Quick Ratio (Acid Test)</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  A stricter version of the current ratio. It excludes inventory because inventory can be hard to sell quickly (especially perishable goods, seasonal items, or slow-moving stock). This gives you a more conservative picture of your ability to pay short-term debts.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded font-mono text-sm">
                  Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) &divide; Current Liabilities
                </div>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-3">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> Sarah's bakery has $80,000 in current assets, but $25,000 of that is flour, sugar, and packaging inventory. Quick ratio = ($80,000 - $25,000) &divide; $40,000 = <strong>1.375</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="mt-3 text-sm">
                  <span class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 font-medium">Healthy:</span> Above 1.0 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
                  <span class="text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400 font-medium">Watch:</span> 0.5 to 1.0 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
                  <span class="text-red-600 dark:text-red-400 font-medium">Danger:</span> Below 0.5
                </div>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-2">
                  The quick ratio matters most for businesses with large inventory (retail, manufacturing, food service). If your business is service-based with little inventory, the current and quick ratios will be nearly identical.
                </p>
              </div>

              <!-- Working Capital -->
              <div class="p-5 bg-[var(--color-card)] rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border)]">
                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Working Capital</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  Not technically a ratio but a dollar amount that shows your short-term financial cushion. It tells you how much money you'd have left if you paid off every short-term obligation today. Lenders look at this number closely.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded font-mono text-sm">
                  Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
                </div>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-3">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> Sarah's bakery: $80,000 - $40,000 = <strong>$40,000</strong> in working capital. That's a $40,000 buffer to handle unexpected expenses, slow months, or growth opportunities.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-2">
                  Negative working capital is a red flag — it means you'd need to borrow or sell long-term assets to cover what's due soon. Track this monthly and watch the trend. Declining working capital, even if still positive, signals trouble ahead.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Profitability Ratios</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Profitability ratios measure how effectively your business generates profit from its operations. While revenue tells you how much you sell, these ratios tell you how much you actually <em>keep</em>. They're essential for comparing your performance against competitors and tracking whether your business is becoming more or less efficient over time.

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  Shows the percentage of revenue left after paying direct production costs (materials, labor to make the product, manufacturing overhead). This is your first-line profitability measure and tells you whether your core pricing and production are healthy.

                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded font-mono text-sm">

                  <strong>Example:</strong> Mike's retail store does $300,000 in revenue. His cost of goods (wholesale purchases, shipping to store) is $180,000. Gross margin = ($300,000 - $180,000) &divide; $300,000 = <strong>40%</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="mt-3 text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                  <strong>Benchmarks:</strong> Software 70-85%, professional services 50-70%, retail 25-50%, grocery 25-30%, restaurants 60-70%.

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  The bottom line — what percentage of every dollar in revenue you actually keep after <em>all</em> expenses: COGS, operating costs, interest, and taxes. This is the ratio most people mean when they say "profit margin."
                </p>
                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded font-mono text-sm">
                  Net Margin = Net Income &divide; Revenue &times; 100

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-3">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> Mike's store has $300,000 in revenue and $258,000 in total expenses (COGS + rent + salaries + taxes + everything else). Net income = $42,000. Net margin = $42,000 &divide; $300,000 = <strong>14%</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="mt-3 text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                  <strong>Benchmarks:</strong> Software 15-25%, professional services 10-20%, retail 2-5%, grocery 1-3%. A shrinking gap between gross and net margin means your overhead is growing faster than revenue — a common trap in scaling businesses.

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mb-3">
                  Measures the return generated from a specific investment, whether that's a marketing campaign, a new piece of equipment, or a business expansion. ROI helps you compare different investment options and decide where to put your money.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-[var(--color-background)] p-3 rounded font-mono text-sm">

                <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)] mt-3">
                  <strong>Example:</strong> Mike spends $5,000 on a Google Ads campaign that generates $18,000 in sales with $10,800 in COGS. Net profit = $18,000 - $10,800 - $5,000 = $2,200. ROI = $2,200 &divide; $5,000 = <strong>44%</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="mt-3 text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
                  Any positive ROI means you made money on the investment. But compare it against alternatives — if a savings account earns 5% and your marketing campaign returns 8%, the campaign is better but not by much once you factor in risk and effort.

                  Shows how efficiently you're using the money you (and any other owners) have invested in the business. It answers: for every dollar of owner investment, how much profit does the business generate?

                  If your ROE is consistently below what you could earn in index funds (roughly 8-10% historically), you might be better off investing your capital elsewhere — at least financially. Many business owners accept lower ROE for the autonomy and fulfillment of running their own company, which is a valid choice.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Leverage Ratios</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Leverage ratios reveal how much your business relies on debt versus equity (owner's money) to finance its operations. Debt isn't inherently bad — it lets you grow faster than self-funding alone. But too much debt creates fragility. If revenue dips or interest rates rise, heavily leveraged businesses are the first to struggle.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Lenders scrutinize leverage ratios before approving loans. If your ratios show you're already carrying heavy debt, getting additional financing becomes harder and more expensive. Knowing these numbers before you walk into a bank puts you in a stronger position.

                  A ratio of 0.3 means Lisa has borrowed $0.30 for every $1.00 of equity — very conservative. A ratio above 2.0 means the business owes more than twice what the owners have put in, which makes the business vulnerable to revenue swings. Capital-intensive industries (manufacturing, real estate) naturally run higher ratios than service businesses.

            <p class="mb-4">
              Efficiency ratios (also called activity ratios) measure how well you use your assets to generate revenue. They expose operational bottlenecks — slow-moving inventory, customers who pay late, or underused equipment. These are the ratios that translate directly into actionable improvements.

              While profitability tells you <em>what</em> you're earning, efficiency tells you <em>how well</em> you're running the machine. Two businesses with identical profit margins can have wildly different efficiency ratios, and the more efficient one will almost always be in a stronger position long-term.

Investigate: are customers paying slower? Are costs creeping up? Is inventory accumulating? Catch this early or it becomes a crisis.

            <p class="mb-4">
              Always compare your ratios against others in your industry, not against generic targets. A SaaS company with an inventory turnover of 0 and a debt-to-equity of 0.1 isn't comparable to a manufacturing firm with turnover of 6 and D/E of 1.5. Both can be perfectly healthy — they just operate in different realities.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The best sources for small business benchmarks are industry associations, the Annual Statement Studies by RMA (Risk Management Association), and IRS SOI (Statistics of Income) data, which publishes average financial ratios by industry and revenue bracket. Your accountant or bookkeeper should be able to help you find the right benchmarks for your specific business.
